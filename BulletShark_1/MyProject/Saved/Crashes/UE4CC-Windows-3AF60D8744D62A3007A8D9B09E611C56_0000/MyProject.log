[2019.02.08-01.03.45:183][124]DoNNavigationLog: Warning: Rules for passing vectors to the system:
----------------------------------------
1. Origin and Destination points _must_ be in empty space. They cannot be inside any mesh or right on top of a floor with colliders
--
2. Characters and Pawns however, are allowed to use their collision component as origin or destination, but the character Mesh itself must _not_ be configured as BlockAll or BlockAllDynamic.
You can use the default "Pawn" collision profile (default) for character meshes as long as you haven't added it to the ObstacleQueryChannels list in your Don Navigation Manager actor
--
3. Trigger volumes cannot the same object type as obstacles (don't use WorldStatic/WorldDynamic/etc). The reason for this is that the system uses overlaps instead of sweeps for optimal performance.
Please create a new trigger object type for all triggers in your map and use that to avoid trigger volumes being from picked up as obstacles.

[2019.02.08-01.03.45:879][173]DoNNavigationLog: Warning: Rules for passing vectors to the system:
----------------------------------------
1. Origin and Destination points _must_ be in empty space. They cannot be inside any mesh or right on top of a floor with colliders
--
2. Characters and Pawns however, are allowed to use their collision component as origin or destination, but the character Mesh itself must _not_ be configured as BlockAll or BlockAllDynamic.
You can use the default "Pawn" collision profile (default) for character meshes as long as you haven't added it to the ObstacleQueryChannels list in your Don Navigation Manager actor
--
3. Trigger volumes cannot the same object type as obstacles (don't use WorldStatic/WorldDynamic/etc). The reason for this is that the system uses overlaps instead of sweeps for optimal performance.
Please create a new trigger object type for all triggers in your map and use that to avoid trigger volumes being from picked up as obstacles.

[2019.02.08-01.03.49:765][462]DoNNavigationLog: Warning: Rules for passing vectors to the system:
----------------------------------------
1. Origin and Destination points _must_ be in empty space. They cannot be inside any mesh or right on top of a floor with colliders
--
2. Characters and Pawns however, are allowed to use their collision component as origin or destination, but the character Mesh itself must _not_ be configured as BlockAll or BlockAllDynamic.
You can use the default "Pawn" collision profile (default) for character meshes as long as you haven't added it to the ObstacleQueryChannels list in your Don Navigation Manager actor
--
3. Trigger volumes cannot the same object type as obstacles (don't use WorldStatic/WorldDynamic/etc). The reason for this is that the system uses overlaps instead of sweeps for optimal performance.
Please create a new trigger object type for all triggers in your map and use that to avoid trigger volumes being from picked up as obstacles.

[2019.02.08-01.03.50:571][518]DoNNavigationLog: Warning: Rules for passing vectors to the system:
----------------------------------------
1. Origin and Destination points _must_ be in empty space. They cannot be inside any mesh or right on top of a floor with colliders
--
2. Characters and Pawns however, are allowed to use their collision component as origin or destination, but the character Mesh itself must _not_ be configured as BlockAll or BlockAllDynamic.
You can use the default "Pawn" collision profile (default) for character meshes as long as you haven't added it to the ObstacleQueryChannels list in your Don Navigation Manager actor
--
3. Trigger volumes cannot the same object type as obstacles (don't use WorldStatic/WorldDynamic/etc). The reason for this is that the system uses overlaps instead of sweeps for optimal performance.
Please create a new trigger object type for all triggers in your map and use that to avoid trigger volumes being from picked up as obstacles.

[2019.02.08-01.03.53:070][618]DoNNavigationLog: Warning: Rules for passing vectors to the system:
----------------------------------------
1. Origin and Destination points _must_ be in empty space. They cannot be inside any mesh or right on top of a floor with colliders
--
2. Characters and Pawns however, are allowed to use their collision component as origin or destination, but the character Mesh itself must _not_ be configured as BlockAll or BlockAllDynamic.
You can use the default "Pawn" collision profile (default) for character meshes as long as you haven't added it to the ObstacleQueryChannels list in your Don Navigation Manager actor
--
3. Trigger volumes cannot the same object type as obstacles (don't use WorldStatic/WorldDynamic/etc). The reason for this is that the system uses overlaps instead of sweeps for optimal performance.
Please create a new trigger object type for all triggers in your map and use that to avoid trigger volumes being from picked up as obstacles.

[2019.02.08-01.07.44:562][598]DoNNavigationLog: Warning: Rules for passing vectors to the system:
----------------------------------------
1. Origin and Destination points _must_ be in empty space. They cannot be inside any mesh or right on top of a floor with colliders
--
2. Characters and Pawns however, are allowed to use their collision component as origin or destination, but the character Mesh itself must _not_ be configured as BlockAll or BlockAllDynamic.
You can use the default "Pawn" collision profile (default) for character meshes as long as you haven't added it to the ObstacleQueryChannels list in your Don Navigation Manager actor
--
3. Trigger volumes cannot the same object type as obstacles (don't use WorldStatic/WorldDynamic/etc). The reason for this is that the system uses overlaps instead of sweeps for optimal performance.
Please create a new trigger object type for all triggers in your map and use that to avoid trigger volumes being from picked up as obstacles.

[2019.02.08-01.07.45:996][677]DoNNavigationLog: Warning: Rules for passing vectors to the system:
----------------------------------------
1. Origin and Destination points _must_ be in empty space. They cannot be inside any mesh or right on top of a floor with colliders
--
2. Characters and Pawns however, are allowed to use their collision component as origin or destination, but the character Mesh itself must _not_ be configured as BlockAll or BlockAllDynamic.
You can use the default "Pawn" collision profile (default) for character meshes as long as you haven't added it to the ObstacleQueryChannels list in your Don Navigation Manager actor
--
3. Trigger volumes cannot the same object type as obstacles (don't use WorldStatic/WorldDynamic/etc). The reason for this is that the system uses overlaps instead of sweeps for optimal performance.
Please create a new trigger object type for all triggers in your map and use that to avoid trigger volumes being from picked up as obstacles.

[2019.02.08-01.07.47:219][736]DoNNavigationLog: Warning: Rules for passing vectors to the system:
----------------------------------------
1. Origin and Destination points _must_ be in empty space. They cannot be inside any mesh or right on top of a floor with colliders
--
2. Characters and Pawns however, are allowed to use their collision component as origin or destination, but the character Mesh itself must _not_ be configured as BlockAll or BlockAllDynamic.
You can use the default "Pawn" collision profile (default) for character meshes as long as you haven't added it to the ObstacleQueryChannels list in your Don Navigation Manager actor
--
3. Trigger volumes cannot the same object type as obstacles (don't use WorldStatic/WorldDynamic/etc). The reason for this is that the system uses overlaps instead of sweeps for optimal performance.
Please create a new trigger object type for all triggers in your map and use that to avoid trigger volumes being from picked up as obstacles.

----------------------------------------
1. Origin and Destination points _must_ be in empty space. They cannot be inside any mesh or right on top of a floor with colliders
--
2. Characters and Pawns however, are allowed to use their collision component as origin or destination, but the character Mesh itself must _not_ be configured as BlockAll or BlockAllDynamic.
You can use the default "Pawn" collision profile (default) for character meshes as long as you haven't added it to the ObstacleQueryChannels list in your Don Navigation Manager actor

3. Trigger volumes cannot the same object type as obstacles (don't use WorldStatic/WorldDynamic/etc). The reason for this is that the system uses overlaps instead of sweeps for optimal performance.
Please create a new trigger object type for all triggers in your map and use that to avoid trigger volumes being from picked up as obstacles.

[2019.02.08-01.07.50:355][901]DoNNavigationLog: Warning: Rules for passing vectors to the system:
----------------------------------------
1. Origin and Destination points _must_ be in empty space. They cannot be inside any mesh or right on top of a floor with colliders
--
2. Characters and Pawns however, are allowed to use their collision component as origin or destination, but the character Mesh itself must _not_ be configured as BlockAll or BlockAllDynamic.
You can use the default "Pawn" collision profile (default) for character meshes as long as you haven't added it to the ObstacleQueryChannels list in your Don Navigation Manager actor
--
3. Trigger volumes cannot the same object type as obstacles (don't use WorldStatic/WorldDynamic/etc). The reason for this is that the system uses overlaps instead of sweeps for optimal performance.
Please create a new trigger object type for all triggers in your map and use that to avoid trigger volumes being from picked up as obstacles.

[2019.02.08-01.07.55:830][169]DoNNavigationLog: Warning: Rules for passing vectors to the system:
----------------------------------------
1. Origin and Destination points _must_ be in empty space. They cannot be inside any mesh or right on top of a floor with colliders
--
2. Characters and Pawns however, are allowed to use their collision component as origin or destination, but the character Mesh itself must _not_ be configured as BlockAll or BlockAllDynamic.
You can use the default "Pawn" collision profile (default) for character meshes as long as you haven't added it to the ObstacleQueryChannels list in your Don Navigation Manager actor
--
3. Trigger volumes cannot the same object type as obstacles (don't use WorldStatic/WorldDynamic/etc). The reason for this is that the system uses overlaps instead of sweeps for optimal performance.
Please create a new trigger object type for all triggers in your map and use that to avoid trigger volumes being from picked up as obstacles.

[2019.02.08-01.07.57:351][237]DoNNavigationLog: Warning: Rules for passing vectors to the system:
----------------------------------------
1. Origin and Destination points _must_ be in empty space. They cannot be inside any mesh or right on top of a floor with colliders
--
2. Characters and Pawns however, are allowed to use their collision component as origin or destination, but the character Mesh itself must _not_ be configured as BlockAll or BlockAllDynamic.
You can use the default "Pawn" collision profile (default) for character meshes as long as you haven't added it to the ObstacleQueryChannels list in your Don Navigation Manager actor
--
3. Trigger volumes cannot the same object type as obstacles (don't use WorldStatic/WorldDynamic/etc). The reason for this is that the system uses overlaps instead of sweeps for optimal performance.
Please create a new trigger object type for all triggers in your map and use that to avoid trigger volumes being from picked up as obstacles.

[2019.02.08-01.08.00:936][424]DoNNavigationLog: Warning: Rules for passing vectors to the system:
----------------------------------------
1. Origin and Destination points _must_ be in empty space. They cannot be inside any mesh or right on top of a floor with colliders
--
2. Characters and Pawns however, are allowed to use their collision component as origin or destination, but the character Mesh itself must _not_ be configured as BlockAll or BlockAllDynamic.
You can use the default "Pawn" collision profile (default) for character meshes as long as you haven't added it to the ObstacleQueryChannels list in your Don Navigation Manager actor
--
3. Trigger volumes cannot the same object type as obstacles (don't use WorldStatic/WorldDynamic/etc). The reason for this is that the system uses overlaps instead of sweeps for optimal performance.
Please create a new trigger object type for all triggers in your map and use that to avoid trigger volumes being from picked up as obstacles.

[2019.02.08-01.08.03:945][570]DoNNavigationLog: Warning: Rules for passing vectors to the system:
----------------------------------------
1. Origin and Destination points _must_ be in empty space. They cannot be inside any mesh or right on top of a floor with colliders
--
2. Characters and Pawns however, are allowed to use their collision component as origin or destination, but the character Mesh itself must _not_ be configured as BlockAll or BlockAllDynamic.
You can use the default "Pawn" collision profile (default) for character meshes as long as you haven't added it to the ObstacleQueryChannels list in your Don Navigation Manager actor
--
3. Trigger volumes cannot the same object type as obstacles (don't use WorldStatic/WorldDynamic/etc). The reason for this is that the system uses overlaps instead of sweeps for optimal performance.
Please create a new trigger object type for all triggers in your map and use that to avoid trigger volumes being from picked up as obstacles.

[2019.02.08-01.08.05:478][647]DoNNavigationLog: Warning: Rules for passing vectors to the system:
----------------------------------------
1. Origin and Destination points _must_ be in empty space. They cannot be inside any mesh or right on top of a floor with colliders
--
2. Characters and Pawns however, are allowed to use their collision component as origin or destination, but the character Mesh itself must _not_ be configured as BlockAll or BlockAllDynamic.
You can use the default "Pawn" collision profile (default) for character meshes as long as you haven't added it to the ObstacleQueryChannels list in your Don Navigation Manager actor
--
3. Trigger volumes cannot the same object type as obstacles (don't use WorldStatic/WorldDynamic/etc). The reason for this is that the system uses overlaps instead of sweeps for optimal performance.
Please create a new trigger object type for all triggers in your map and use that to avoid trigger volumes being from picked up as obstacles.

[2019.02.08-01.09.01:968][752]DoNNavigationLog: Warning: Rules for passing vectors to the system:
----------------------------------------
1. Origin and Destination points _must_ be in empty space. They cannot be inside any mesh or right on top of a floor with colliders
--
2. Characters and Pawns however, are allowed to use their collision component as origin or destination, but the character Mesh itself must _not_ be configured as BlockAll or BlockAllDynamic.
You can use the default "Pawn" collision profile (default) for character meshes as long as you haven't added it to the ObstacleQueryChannels list in your Don Navigation Manager actor
--
3. Trigger volumes cannot the same object type as obstacles (don't use WorldStatic/WorldDynamic/etc). The reason for this is that the system uses overlaps instead of sweeps for optimal performance.
Please create a new trigger object type for all triggers in your map and use that to avoid trigger volumes being from picked up as obstacles.

[2019.02.08-01.09.02:356][773]DoNNavigationLog: Warning: Rules for passing vectors to the system:
----------------------------------------
1. Origin and Destination points _must_ be in empty space. They cannot be inside any mesh or right on top of a floor with colliders
--
2. Characters and Pawns however, are allowed to use their collision component as origin or destination, but the character Mesh itself must _not_ be configured as BlockAll or BlockAllDynamic.
You can use the default "Pawn" collision profile (default) for character meshes as long as you haven't added it to the ObstacleQueryChannels list in your Don Navigation Manager actor
--
3. Trigger volumes cannot the same object type as obstacles (don't use WorldStatic/WorldDynamic/etc). The reason for this is that the system uses overlaps instead of sweeps for optimal performance.
Please create a new trigger object type for all triggers in your map and use that to avoid trigger volumes being from picked up as obstacles.

[2019.02.08-01.09.03:102][827]DoNNavigationLog: Warning: Rules for passing vectors to the system:
----------------------------------------
1. Origin and Destination points _must_ be in empty space. They cannot be inside any mesh or right on top of a floor with colliders
--
2. Characters and Pawns however, are allowed to use their collision component as origin or destination, but the character Mesh itself must _not_ be configured as BlockAll or BlockAllDynamic.
You can use the default "Pawn" collision profile (default) for character meshes as long as you haven't added it to the ObstacleQueryChannels list in your Don Navigation Manager actor
--
3. Trigger volumes cannot the same object type as obstacles (don't use WorldStatic/WorldDynamic/etc). The reason for this is that the system uses overlaps instead of sweeps for optimal performance.
Please create a new trigger object type for all triggers in your map and use that to avoid trigger volumes being from picked up as obstacles.

[2019.02.08-01.09.07:947][147]DoNNavigationLog: Warning: Rules for passing vectors to the system:
----------------------------------------
1. Origin and Destination points _must_ be in empty space. They cannot be inside any mesh or right on top of a floor with colliders
--
2. Characters and Pawns however, are allowed to use their collision component as origin or destination, but the character Mesh itself must _not_ be configured as BlockAll or BlockAllDynamic.
You can use the default "Pawn" collision profile (default) for character meshes as long as you haven't added it to the ObstacleQueryChannels list in your Don Navigation Manager actor
--
3. Trigger volumes cannot the same object type as obstacles (don't use WorldStatic/WorldDynamic/etc). The reason for this is that the system uses overlaps instead of sweeps for optimal performance.
Please create a new trigger object type for all triggers in your map and use that to avoid trigger volumes being from picked up as obstacles.

[2019.02.08-01.09.09:408][234]DoNNavigationLog: Warning: Rules for passing vectors to the system:
----------------------------------------
1. Origin and Destination points _must_ be in empty space. They cannot be inside any mesh or right on top of a floor with colliders
--
2. Characters and Pawns however, are allowed to use their collision component as origin or destination, but the character Mesh itself must _not_ be configured as BlockAll or BlockAllDynamic.
You can use the default "Pawn" collision profile (default) for character meshes as long as you haven't added it to the ObstacleQueryChannels list in your Don Navigation Manager actor
--
3. Trigger volumes cannot the same object type as obstacles (don't use WorldStatic/WorldDynamic/etc). The reason for this is that the system uses overlaps instead of sweeps for optimal performance.
Please create a new trigger object type for all triggers in your map and use that to avoid trigger volumes being from picked up as obstacles.

1. Origin and Destination points _must_ be in empty space. They cannot be inside any mesh or right on top of a floor with colliders
--
2. Characters and Pawns however, are allowed to use their collision component as origin or destination, but the character Mesh itself must _not_ be configured as BlockAll or BlockAllDynamic.
You can use the default "Pawn" collision profile (default) for character meshes as long as you haven't added it to the ObstacleQueryChannels list in your Don Navigation Manager actor
--
3. Trigger volumes cannot the same object type as obstacles (don't use WorldStatic/WorldDynamic/etc). The reason for this is that the system uses overlaps instead of sweeps for optimal performance.
Please create a new trigger object type for all triggers in your map and use that to avoid trigger volumes being from picked up as obstacles.

[2019.02.08-01.09.11:712][369]DoNNavigationLog: Warning: Rules for passing vectors to the system:
----------------------------------------
1. Origin and Destination points _must_ be in empty space. They cannot be inside any mesh or right on top of a floor with colliders
--
2. Characters and Pawns however, are allowed to use their collision component as origin or destination, but the character Mesh itself must _not_ be configured as BlockAll or BlockAllDynamic.
You can use the default "Pawn" collision profile (default) for character meshes as long as you haven't added it to the ObstacleQueryChannels list in your Don Navigation Manager actor
--
3. Trigger volumes cannot the same object type as obstacles (don't use WorldStatic/WorldDynamic/etc). The reason for this is that the system uses overlaps instead of sweeps for optimal performance.
Please create a new trigger object type for all triggers in your map and use that to avoid trigger volumes being from picked up as obstacles.

[2019.02.08-01.09.13:601][417]DoNNavigationLog: Warning: Rules for passing vectors to the system:
----------------------------------------
1. Origin and Destination points _must_ be in empty space. They cannot be inside any mesh or right on top of a floor with colliders
--
2. Characters and Pawns however, are allowed to use their collision component as origin or destination, but the character Mesh itself must _not_ be configured as BlockAll or BlockAllDynamic.
You can use the default "Pawn" collision profile (default) for character meshes as long as you haven't added it to the ObstacleQueryChannels list in your Don Navigation Manager actor
--
3. Trigger volumes cannot the same object type as obstacles (don't use WorldStatic/WorldDynamic/etc). The reason for this is that the system uses overlaps instead of sweeps for optimal performance.
Please create a new trigger object type for all triggers in your map and use that to avoid trigger volumes being from picked up as obstacles.

----------------------------------------
1. Origin and Destination points _must_ be in empty space. They cannot be inside any mesh or right on top of a floor with colliders
--
2. Characters and Pawns however, are allowed to use their collision component as origin or destination, but the character Mesh itself must _not_ be configured as BlockAll or BlockAllDynamic.
You can use the default "Pawn" collision profile (default) for character meshes as long as you haven't added it to the ObstacleQueryChannels list in your Don Navigation Manager actor
--
3. Trigger volumes cannot the same object type as obstacles (don't use WorldStatic/WorldDynamic/etc). The reason for this is that the system uses overlaps instead of sweeps for optimal performance.
Please create a new trigger object type for all triggers in your map and use that to avoid trigger volumes being from picked up as obstacles.

----------------------------------------
1. Origin and Destination points _must_ be in empty space. They cannot be inside any mesh or right on top of a floor with colliders
--
2. Characters and Pawns however, are allowed to use their collision component as origin or destination, but the character Mesh itself must _not_ be configured as BlockAll or BlockAllDynamic.
You can use the default "Pawn" collision profile (default) for character meshes as long as you haven't added it to the ObstacleQueryChannels list in your Don Navigation Manager actor
--
3. Trigger volumes cannot the same object type as obstacles (don't use WorldStatic/WorldDynamic/etc). The reason for this is that the system uses overlaps instead of sweeps for optimal performance.
Please create a new trigger object type for all triggers in your map and use that to avoid trigger volumes being from picked up as obstacles.

[2019.02.08-01.09.15:792][531]DoNNavigationLog: Warning: Rules for passing vectors to the system:
----------------------------------------
1. Origin and Destination points _must_ be in empty space. They cannot be inside any mesh or right on top of a floor with colliders
--
2. Characters and Pawns however, are allowed to use their collision component as origin or destination, but the character Mesh itself must _not_ be configured as BlockAll or BlockAllDynamic.
You can use the default "Pawn" collision profile (default) for character meshes as long as you haven't added it to the ObstacleQueryChannels list in your Don Navigation Manager actor
--
3. Trigger volumes cannot the same object type as obstacles (don't use WorldStatic/WorldDynamic/etc). The reason for this is that the system uses overlaps instead of sweeps for optimal performance.
Please create a new trigger object type for all triggers in your map and use that to avoid trigger volumes being from picked up as obstacles.

[2019.02.08-01.09.16:274][555]DoNNavigationLog: Warning: Rules for passing vectors to the system:
----------------------------------------
1. Origin and Destination points _must_ be in empty space. They cannot be inside any mesh or right on top of a floor with colliders
--
2. Characters and Pawns however, are allowed to use their collision component as origin or destination, but the character Mesh itself must _not_ be configured as BlockAll or BlockAllDynamic.
You can use the default "Pawn" collision profile (default) for character meshes as long as you haven't added it to the ObstacleQueryChannels list in your Don Navigation Manager actor
--
3. Trigger volumes cannot the same object type as obstacles (don't use WorldStatic/WorldDynamic/etc). The reason for this is that the system uses overlaps instead of sweeps for optimal performance.
Please create a new trigger object type for all triggers in your map and use that to avoid trigger volumes being from picked up as obstacles.

[2019.02.08-01.09.18:629][683]DoNNavigationLog: Warning: Rules for passing vectors to the system:
----------------------------------------
1. Origin and Destination points _must_ be in empty space. They cannot be inside any mesh or right on top of a floor with colliders
--
2. Characters and Pawns however, are allowed to use their collision component as origin or destination, but the character Mesh itself must _not_ be configured as BlockAll or BlockAllDynamic.
You can use the default "Pawn" collision profile (default) for character meshes as long as you haven't added it to the ObstacleQueryChannels list in your Don Navigation Manager actor
--
3. Trigger volumes cannot the same object type as obstacles (don't use WorldStatic/WorldDynamic/etc). The reason for this is that the system uses overlaps instead of sweeps for optimal performance.
Please create a new trigger object type for all triggers in your map and use that to avoid trigger volumes being from picked up as obstacles.

[2019.02.08-01.09.19:304][709]DoNNavigationLog: Warning: Rules for passing vectors to the system:
----------------------------------------
1. Origin and Destination points _must_ be in empty space. They cannot be inside any mesh or right on top of a floor with colliders
--
2. Characters and Pawns however, are allowed to use their collision component as origin or destination, but the character Mesh itself must _not_ be configured as BlockAll or BlockAllDynamic.
You can use the default "Pawn" collision profile (default) for character meshes as long as you haven't added it to the ObstacleQueryChannels list in your Don Navigation Manager actor
--
3. Trigger volumes cannot the same object type as obstacles (don't use WorldStatic/WorldDynamic/etc). The reason for this is that the system uses overlaps instead of sweeps for optimal performance.
Please create a new trigger object type for all triggers in your map and use that to avoid trigger volumes being from picked up as obstacles.

[2019.02.08-01.09.19:972][741]DoNNavigationLog: Warning: Rules for passing vectors to the system:
----------------------------------------
1. Origin and Destination points _must_ be in empty space. They cannot be inside any mesh or right on top of a floor with colliders
--
2. Characters and Pawns however, are allowed to use their collision component as origin or destination, but the character Mesh itself must _not_ be configured as BlockAll or BlockAllDynamic.
You can use the default "Pawn" collision profile (default) for character meshes as long as you haven't added it to the ObstacleQueryChannels list in your Don Navigation Manager actor
--
3. Trigger volumes cannot the same object type as obstacles (don't use WorldStatic/WorldDynamic/etc). The reason for this is that the system uses overlaps instead of sweeps for optimal performance.
Please create a new trigger object type for all triggers in your map and use that to avoid trigger volumes being from picked up as obstacles.

[2019.02.08-01.09.20:952][793]DoNNavigationLog: Warning: Rules for passing vectors to the system:
----------------------------------------
1. Origin and Destination points _must_ be in empty space. They cannot be inside any mesh or right on top of a floor with colliders
--
2. Characters and Pawns however, are allowed to use their collision component as origin or destination, but the character Mesh itself must _not_ be configured as BlockAll or BlockAllDynamic.
You can use the default "Pawn" collision profile (default) for character meshes as long as you haven't added it to the ObstacleQueryChannels list in your Don Navigation Manager actor
--
3. Trigger volumes cannot the same object type as obstacles (don't use WorldStatic/WorldDynamic/etc). The reason for this is that the system uses overlaps instead of sweeps for optimal performance.
Please create a new trigger object type for all triggers in your map and use that to avoid trigger volumes being from picked up as obstacles.

[2019.02.08-01.09.23:146][897]DoNNavigationLog: Warning: Rules for passing vectors to the system:
----------------------------------------
1. Origin and Destination points _must_ be in empty space. They cannot be inside any mesh or right on top of a floor with colliders
--
2. Characters and Pawns however, are allowed to use their collision component as origin or destination, but the character Mesh itself must _not_ be configured as BlockAll or BlockAllDynamic.
You can use the default "Pawn" collision profile (default) for character meshes as long as you haven't added it to the ObstacleQueryChannels list in your Don Navigation Manager actor
--
3. Trigger volumes cannot the same object type as obstacles (don't use WorldStatic/WorldDynamic/etc). The reason for this is that the system uses overlaps instead of sweeps for optimal performance.
Please create a new trigger object type for all triggers in your map and use that to avoid trigger volumes being from picked up as obstacles.

[2019.02.08-01.09.24:743][968]DoNNavigationLog: Warning: Rules for passing vectors to the system:
----------------------------------------
1. Origin and Destination points _must_ be in empty space. They cannot be inside any mesh or right on top of a floor with colliders
--
2. Characters and Pawns however, are allowed to use their collision component as origin or destination, but the character Mesh itself must _not_ be configured as BlockAll or BlockAllDynamic.
You can use the default "Pawn" collision profile (default) for character meshes as long as you haven't added it to the ObstacleQueryChannels list in your Don Navigation Manager actor
--
3. Trigger volumes cannot the same object type as obstacles (don't use WorldStatic/WorldDynamic/etc). The reason for this is that the system uses overlaps instead of sweeps for optimal performance.
Please create a new trigger object type for all triggers in your map and use that to avoid trigger volumes being from picked up as obstacles.

[2019.02.08-01.09.25:716][  8]DoNNavigationLog: Warning: Rules for passing vectors to the system:
----------------------------------------
1. Origin and Destination points _must_ be in empty space. They cannot be inside any mesh or right on top of a floor with colliders
--
2. Characters and Pawns however, are allowed to use their collision component as origin or destination, but the character Mesh itself must _not_ be configured as BlockAll or BlockAllDynamic.
You can use the default "Pawn" collision profile (default) for character meshes as long as you haven't added it to the ObstacleQueryChannels list in your Don Navigation Manager actor
--
3. Trigger volumes cannot the same object type as obstacles (don't use WorldStatic/WorldDynamic/etc). The reason for this is that the system uses overlaps instead of sweeps for optimal performance.
Please create a new trigger object type for all triggers in your map and use that to avoid trigger volumes being from picked up as obstacles.

[2019.02.08-01.09.26:299][ 34]DoNNavigationLog: Warning: Rules for passing vectors to the system:
----------------------------------------
1. Origin and Destination points _must_ be in empty space. They cannot be inside any mesh or right on top of a floor with colliders
--
2. Characters and Pawns however, are allowed to use their collision component as origin or destination, but the character Mesh itself must _not_ be configured as BlockAll or BlockAllDynamic.
You can use the default "Pawn" collision profile (default) for character meshes as long as you haven't added it to the ObstacleQueryChannels list in your Don Navigation Manager actor
--
3. Trigger volumes cannot the same object type as obstacles (don't use WorldStatic/WorldDynamic/etc). The reason for this is that the system uses overlaps instead of sweeps for optimal performance.
Please create a new trigger object type for all triggers in your map and use that to avoid trigger volumes being from picked up as obstacles.

[2019.02.08-01.09.26:676][ 50]DoNNavigationLog: Warning: Rules for passing vectors to the system:
----------------------------------------
1. Origin and Destination points _must_ be in empty space. They cannot be inside any mesh or right on top of a floor with colliders
--
2. Characters and Pawns however, are allowed to use their collision component as origin or destination, but the character Mesh itself must _not_ be configured as BlockAll or BlockAllDynamic.
You can use the default "Pawn" collision profile (default) for character meshes as long as you haven't added it to the ObstacleQueryChannels list in your Don Navigation Manager actor
--
3. Trigger volumes cannot the same object type as obstacles (don't use WorldStatic/WorldDynamic/etc). The reason for this is that the system uses overlaps instead of sweeps for optimal performance.
Please create a new trigger object type for all triggers in your map and use that to avoid trigger volumes being from picked up as obstacles.

[2019.02.08-01.09.27:191][ 72]DoNNavigationLog: Warning: Rules for passing vectors to the system:
----------------------------------------
1. Origin and Destination points _must_ be in empty space. They cannot be inside any mesh or right on top of a floor with colliders
--
2. Characters and Pawns however, are allowed to use their collision component as origin or destination, but the character Mesh itself must _not_ be configured as BlockAll or BlockAllDynamic.
You can use the default "Pawn" collision profile (default) for character meshes as long as you haven't added it to the ObstacleQueryChannels list in your Don Navigation Manager actor
--
3. Trigger volumes cannot the same object type as obstacles (don't use WorldStatic/WorldDynamic/etc). The reason for this is that the system uses overlaps instead of sweeps for optimal performance.
Please create a new trigger object type for all triggers in your map and use that to avoid trigger volumes being from picked up as obstacles.
